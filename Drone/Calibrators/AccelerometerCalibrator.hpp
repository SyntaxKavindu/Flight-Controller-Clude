// Recommended sample-buffer capacity for a tumble -- the caller now supplies

// averages, which is why that mode costs nothing here.

// A fit can satisfy every structural check and still not describe the data:
// readings with no ellipsoidal structure at all still yield a solution that
// inverts cleanly and is positive definite. The only thing that catches that
// is asking how well the result reproduces the samples. This is the largest
// RMS deviation from 1 g, as a fraction of it, that a tumble fit may leave
// behind and still be accepted. Generous on purpose -- it is here to reject
// nonsense, not to grade a good calibration.
#define ACCEL_CAL_MAX_FIT_RESIDUAL     0.15f

// Note that binning goes through atan2f, so which samples a tumble admits is
// only as reproducible as the libm behind it: a 1 ULP difference at a bin
// boundary puts a sample in a different bin, and coverage is then reached
// after a different number of samples with a slightly different set. Measured
// between two implementations, the same airframe reached coverage at 24033
// samples on one and 26647 on the other, and the fits differed accordingly --
// both correct, neither bit-identical. Accuracy is unaffected (the medians
// moved by under a tenth of a degree across 40 airframes); results simply are
// not bit-reproducible across toolchains, so do not diff them against a
// reference capture taken on a different libm.
//
// Neither procedure notices when it stops making progress: samples that fail
// the motion or stillness gate are simply discarded, isReadyToCalibrate()
// never becomes true, and the caller feeds samples for ever. These are how
// many samples may arrive without the progress figure reaching a new high
// before isStalled() starts reporting it.
//
// The two differ by a lot because of how the gates work. Six-position needs
// SAMPLES_PER_POSITION consecutive good samples and progress climbs with each
// one, so a healthy run never gaps at all; the allowance here is for an
// operator still settling the airframe after sending READY. Tumble only
// accepts a sample once a whole window is still AND lands in an unfilled bin,
// so long gaps are normal -- the longest measured in a successful run was
// 10151 samples, hence the much larger figure. At a 200 Hz control loop these
// are roughly 50 and 200 seconds of no progress.

    //
    // A position needs ACCEL_CAL_SAMPLES_PER_POSITION consecutive samples
    // inside this radius, and any single excursion restarts the count, so the
    // vibration it tolerates is well below the threshold itself. Measured with
    // the 0.5 default: completes reliably up to 0.12 m/s^2 RMS per axis, 1 run
    // in 20 at 0.20, never at 0.30 -- and with no timeout behind it, failing
    // to complete means waiting for ever rather than being told.
    //
    // Note also that six-position fits bias and per-axis scale only -- its
    // correction matrix is diag(1/scale), so every off-diagonal term passes
    // through untouched. Measured, the tilt error it leaves tracks the total

    // of it). getMaxMisalignmentDeg() reports what is being left behind.

    //     NEITHER procedure can remove this, and no amount of tumbling will.
    //     Both fits only ever see the magnitude of gravity, and rotating a
    //     sphere leaves the same sphere, so the data carries no information
    //     about R at all. Measured, 1.16 deg in and 1.16 deg out of both.
    // With both present a tumble removes the S half only (2.03 -> 1.23 deg).

    // known-flat surface and storing the residual attitude -- which is a

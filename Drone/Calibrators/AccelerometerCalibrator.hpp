 *
 * Six-position accelerometer calibration: rest the airframe on each of its six
 * faces in turn, average what the sensor reads, and solve for bias and
 * per-axis scale.
 *
 *     corrected = (raw - bias) / scale
 *
 * which puts the result on a unit sphere -- 1.0 per axis, in whatever units
 * the samples arrived in.
 *
 * What it does NOT fit
 * --------------------
 * Cross-axis terms. The correction is diag(1/scale), so anything off-diagonal
 * passes through untouched: a chip whose axes are not quite perpendicular, or
 * a board sitting rotated in the airframe, is left alone here.
 *
 * That is deliberate rather than a limitation being tolerated. Of the two
 * kinds, only one is this class's to fix. Writing the sensor model as
 * raw = A*g + bias and splitting A = R*S:
 *
 *   S, symmetric -- per-axis scale and cross-axis sensitivity. The scale half
 *     is what this fits. The cross-axis half is small on a modern MEMS part
 *     and needs an ellipsoid fit to separate, which costs a tumble procedure,
 *     a 3.6 kB sample buffer and a minute of the operator's time.
 *   R, a pure rotation -- the board's mounting angle. No fit that only sees
 *     the MAGNITUDE of gravity can recover this at all: rotating a sphere
 *     leaves the same sphere. It needs an outside reference, which is exactly
 *     what LevelCalibrator is -- a known-level surface, and the residual
 *     attitude stored.
 *
 * So the split across the two classes is clean: this one owns bias and scale
 * and produces NO rotation, LevelCalibrator owns the rotation. Nothing here
 * can fight what that stores, which is the property worth protecting.

// Coverage is judged from the centre of the collected cloud rather than from
// the origin, so that a hard-iron offset larger than the field itself cannot
// collapse every sample into a handful of bins. That centre is only knowable
// once samples are in, so the bin table has to be rebuilt as it settles --
// see rebin(). Rebinning is triggered by the centre having moved rather than
// by a sample count, because it is only worth redoing while the estimate is
// still shifting; this is how far it must move to trigger one, as a fraction
// of the nominal radius so that it carries over to whatever units the sensor
// reports in.
#define COMPASS_CAL_REBIN_MOVE_FRACTION  0.10f

// A fit can satisfy every structural check and still not describe the data:
// readings with no ellipsoidal structure at all (a failing sensor, or an
// interference source that moved during the sweep) still yield a solution
// that inverts cleanly and is positive definite. The only thing that catches
// that is asking how well the result actually reproduces the samples. This is
// the largest RMS deviation from the nominal magnitude, as a fraction of it,
// that a fit may leave behind and still be accepted. Generous on purpose --
// it is here to reject nonsense, not to grade a good calibration.
#define COMPASS_CAL_MAX_FIT_RESIDUAL 0.15f

// Collection makes no progress at all if the airframe stops being moved, and
// nothing in the procedure notices: isReadyToCalibrate() simply never becomes
// true and the caller feeds samples for ever. This is how many samples may
// arrive without the progress figure reaching a new high before isStalled()
// starts reporting it. Measured over successful runs the longest such gap was
// 1154 samples, so this leaves roughly 5x headroom; at a 200 Hz control loop
// it is about 30 seconds of no progress.
//
// Note that a sweep sitting exactly on the coverage minimum can go either way
// -- complete, or be reported stalled -- depending on the libm behind atan2f,
// because a 1 ULP difference there moves a sample across a bin boundary.
// Measured between two implementations that decided 2 of 20 borderline seeds
// differently. Both outcomes are correct for input that marginal, and neither
// is a silent hang; a sweep with real margin is unaffected.
#define COMPASS_CAL_STALL_LIMIT    6000U

// Smallest usable nominal field magnitude. Only guards against a zero or
// negative radius -- the value itself is sensor-unit agnostic, so a LIS3MDL
// reporting ~0.5 Gauss is just as valid as a raw-LSB magnitude of ~500.
